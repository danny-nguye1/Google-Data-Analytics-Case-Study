# Cyclistic Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

#### Overview
This repository contains my analysis and findings for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) Capstone Project, a case study on Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company.

#### Introduction
- I assumed the position of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing program in Chicago with over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations
- Customers who purchased single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual riders** while those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic **annual members**

#### Business Task
- The overall goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at **converting casual riders into annual members**
- The primary business question I am assigned to answer is: **"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**

#### Data
- The [data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) used is made publically available from Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC (“Bikeshare”), Divvy bicycle sharing service, under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
